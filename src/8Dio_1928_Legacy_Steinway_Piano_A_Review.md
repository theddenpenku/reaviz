## Features
 
The 1928 Legacy Steinway Piano contains over 11,000 samples and two different microphone perspectives: a close microphone and a player microphone. The close microphone captures the intimate and detailed sound of the piano, while the player microphone gives a more spacious and ambient sound. You can adjust the volume and pan of each microphone separately, or use the mix knob to blend them together.
 
The library also offers a variety of controls and effects to customize the sound of the piano. You can adjust the pedal volume, release volume, noise reduction, EQ, and reverb. You can also choose from 23 presets that range from natural to cinematic to experimental. Additionally, you can blend the piano with other instruments such as guitars, marimba, Rhodes, crotales, bowed percussion, glass marimba, and glockenspiel to create unique hybrid sounds.
 
## Sound Quality
 
The 1928 Legacy Steinway Piano sounds very realistic and expressive. The samples are recorded with high quality and have a lot of dynamic range and variation. The round-robin sustains and staccatos add more realism and naturalness to the playing. The piano has a warm and resonant tone that works well for both solo and ensemble pieces. The library also captures the subtle nuances and noises of the piano, such as pedal noise, key noise, and string resonance.
 
The library also sounds very versatile and flexible. You can use the microphone options and effects to change the tone and mood of the piano. You can make it sound bright or dark, intimate or spacious, dry or wet. You can also use the presets and blending options to create different styles and genres of music. You can make it sound classical, jazz, pop, rock, ambient, or even experimental.
 
## Usability
 
The 1928 Legacy Steinway Piano is easy to use and navigate. The interface is simple and intuitive, with all the controls and options clearly labeled and accessible. You can load the library in Kontakt 5.8.1 or later (full version required) and start playing right away. The library is also relatively light on CPU and RAM usage, considering the amount of samples and effects it offers.
 
The only downside is that the library is quite large in size (10.7 GB) and requires a lot of disk space. You also need a fast internet connection to download it from 8Dio's website. However, these are minor issues compared to the quality and value of the library.
 
## Conclusion
 
The 1928 Legacy Steinway Piano is a great piano library for Kontakt that offers realistic sound quality, versatile features, and easy usability. It is suitable for composers, producers, songwriters, and pianists who are looking for an emotional and resonant piano that can fit any genre or style of music. The library is also reasonably priced at $48 USD (as of April 2023), which makes it a good deal for such a high-quality product.
